The IP allowlist (whitelist) enables you to restrict API calls to only accept specific IP addresses for each API key. Only allowing access to a select number of IP addresses can lower the chances of a security threat or malicious attack.

Alternatively, you can also submit a ticket to [PassToPay](john@chixi88.com) Support with the IP addresses of the machines running your API client(s) and their matching API key(s).
