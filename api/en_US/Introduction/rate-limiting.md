PasstoPay aims to provide a stable and secure platform for all users. For this reason, we monitor traffic from all parties to identify patterns that may negatively affect the network.

If traffic from an account is too high and the rate limit is hit, we may temporarily restrict the account.

Rate limits for traffic are based on a per API endpoint and per minute basis.

**Rate limit error response**  
If you reach your rate limit, you'll see a 429 error response to let you know your rate limit has been exceeded.

**Increasing your rate limit**  
If you would like to raise your rate limits, please contact your account manager or [PassTo](<>) support.

Note: Not all requests to increase rate limits will be honored, and additional charges may apply for higher limits.
